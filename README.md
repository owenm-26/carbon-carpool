# Description
Carbon Carpool creates an incentive for a sustainable practice everybody knows of, but little do. It lets users be rewarded for green commuting by connecting with a friend, coworker, or classmate through an easy to use dApp. The idea is that we make carpooling, a habitual practice in nature, more of an immediate reward. People are aware that they save gas money, but we happen to have a tendency that money saved is very different from money earned.

By acknowledging this shortcoming in mentality and citing it as part of the reason 76% of people drive alone to work (as of 2016), we are combating this unsustainable practice fully. We utilize vechain to make this solution as lightweight, secure, and traceable as possible while also having the rewards of their sustainability feed back into the sustainable market. This is accomplished by the rewards being in the form of discounts / deals to sustainable businesses.

With Carbon Carpool we can make a dent and curb carbon emissions.
